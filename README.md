The application should first have an input form that collects:

The Employee's First and Last name
The Employee's ID Number
The Employee's Job Title
The Employee's Salary (Yearly)
The form should have a submit button that

clears out the form and
stores the submitted information.
Then, that information should be appended to the DOM so the user of the application can see the information they just entered.

Finally, your logic should calculate all of the employee salaries and report back what the monthly cost of salaries is.
